      <description>Well this took me way too long to get up and running! But here we are :) Hello, and welcome! Why another R blog?I’m starting this blog for a few reasons. First, I want to use it as a way to document my own R journey. I figured I’d document it for lots of reasons: a way to showcase my own work, career development, networking, everyone in the R community says you should do it, blah blah blah.</description>
