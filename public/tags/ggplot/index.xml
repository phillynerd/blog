      <description>Welcome, friends, to my first data post! So here’s the background: I love brazilian jiu jitsu (bjj). I did martial arts when I was a kid (bonus story at the end about my favorite martial art moment ever), but stopped going after I had a knee injury that sidelined me for several months. I’d always toyed with the idea of going back, but my wife made me realize how much I actually missed sports when I saw her being crazy active with her HIIT gym.</description>
