&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer, as always, is a super-busy time for us. Not only is work crazy with state reporting and fiscal year reporting, but my wife and I are always running around trying to suck the most out of every nice day before we hibernate. Add a toddler to that equation, and you end up with exactly zero free time. Which, of course, means it’s been a while since my last post.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>Welcome, friends, to my first data post! So here’s the background: I love brazilian jiu jitsu (bjj). I did martial arts when I was a kid (bonus story at the end about my favorite martial art moment ever), but stopped going after I had a knee injury that sidelined me for several months. I’d always toyed with the idea of going back, but my wife made me realize how much I actually missed sports when I saw her being crazy active with her HIIT gym.</description>
