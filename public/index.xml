      <description>Welcome, friends, to my first data post! So here’s the background: I love brazilian jiu jitsu (bjj). I did martial arts when I was a kid (bonus story at the end about my favorite martial art moment ever), but stopped going after I had a knee injury that sidelined me for several months. I’d always toyed with the idea of going back, but my wife made me realize how much I actually missed sports when I saw her being crazy active with her HIIT gym.</description>

      <description>Well this took me way too long to get up and running! But here we are :) Hello, and welcome! Why another R blog?I’m starting this blog for a few reasons. First, I want to use it as a way to document my own R journey. I figured I’d document it for lots of reasons: a way to showcase my own work, career development, networking, everyone in the R community says you should do it, blah blah blah.</description>
